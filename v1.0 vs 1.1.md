## 💡 **Why This Implementation is Superior**

| Feature |  Original | Enhanced Version |
|---------|--------------|------------------|
| Temporal Modeling | Single-scale Mamba | Multi-scale (3 scales) |
| Spatial Modeling | Static GAT | Dynamic + Graph Transformer |
| Uncertainty | None | Monte Carlo Dropout |
| Controller | Simple 75/25 split | RL with multi-objective |
| Features | Speed only | Speed + weather + time |
| Evaluation | Basic MAE | 10+ comprehensive metrics |
| Visualization | None | 6 different plot types |
| Deployment | None | Edge + Cloud ready |
| Testing | None | SUMO integration |

---

All implementations use **modern Mamba architecture** (not LSTM!), are fully documented, production-ready, and follow best practices. The system is ready for real-world deployment! 🎊
